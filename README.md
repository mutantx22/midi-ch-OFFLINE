# Other features
## Open Notes
When on, the chart will treat open notes as a 6th fret, bellow green. (I recommended not using this and instead add open notes in Moon Scraper or EoF after exporting.)

## Frets
The number of frets used in the chart (not counting open notes). The standard is 5 for Expert and Hard, 4 for Medium, and 3 for Easy.

## Max BPS
Any note that's is more than the maximum Beats per second threshold relative to the previous note gets ignored and isn't charted.

## Max Simultaneous Notes
This is the maximum number of notes that the chart will include as a chord. It's worth noting that if a sustain goes past the next note, it's still possible to go above this limit.

## Scale
How many seconds can be seen in the preview on the right.

## Skip Open Notes Limit
When Open Notes is on, strips 1/this beats from open notes

## Ignore Gap
Seconds between notes where it no longer matters if different notes are played on the same fret in succession.

## Sustain Gap multiplier
Allows you to have extra long or short sustain gaps. By default, 1 which puts in  length sustain gaps based on the tempo. 2 would double the length of sustain gaps, 0.5 would half them.

## Leading Silence
Number of seconds of silence at the start of the chart.

Must also be applied to the audio file in order to sync properly, this does not generate an audio file. Any DAW *should* work, although some might create inacurate tempo-maps. FL Studio is a good choice.

## Instrument Toggles
When an instrument is toggled on, (after loading new settings) the chart will incorporate that instrument. Having multiple instruments on will have the chart use all toggled instruments with a preference for higher notes. Deleting notes will remove them from their instrument, not just the chart and will persist after reloading the chart.

## Song Playback
Only plays the notes that the chart is showing

## Chart Preview Map
All the notes of the chart are displayed in miniature on the left of the chart preview with a white line showing where you currently are in the chart.

## Chart Scrubbing
Click (or drag) anywhere in the chart preview to jump to that part of the song shown in the chart preview map

## Pitch Visual Aid
White line that follows the fret it represents, further left being low notes, right being high notes in the range of the 88 keys of a keyboard.

## Instrument Visual Aid
Bellow the check for each instrument on the left, there's a preview of that instruments' notes throughout the song, x-axis is time, y-axis is pitch. The red line represents where the chart playback is.

Each instrument that is checked, upon loading the settings, that instrument will be applied to the chart (provided it doesn't exceed the max simultaneous notes threshold)

## Custom Events
When you save and download the resulting chart, custom chart specific events will be put in in the places where the auto-charter acknowledges that it may have done a poor job, which you can see if you open the chart in MoonScraper. This makes it easier to clean up parts that aren't auto charted well by telling you the spots that might need attention.

### `Bad_Different_Fret`
If a note is the same note as the previous note, but is charted as a different fret, then a `Bad_Different_Fret` event will be placed on that note.

### `Bad_Too_low`
If a note is higher than the previous note, but is charted as a lower fret, then a `Bad_Too_Low` event will be placed on that note.

### `Bad_Too_High`
If a note is lower than the previous note, but is charted as a higher fret, then a `Bad_Too_High` event will be placed on that note.
